The goal of this project is to a program a well made GUI to create, edit, and export way point AI scripts. The scripts are simplistic in nature, just a series of points for an AI entity to walk through. Hard coding these points by hand in code however can be very cumbersome when many entities need to have this type of scripting. This tool will provide a clear 1:1 visual representation of the path you want an entity to follow. The initial version of this project was heavily based off A Simple Java Drawing Tool by Yamir Minhas http://bit.ly/1QDMafe. Yamir's project acted as a good starting place for developing a java GUI.
